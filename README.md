# minimalist-weather-app
A simple, minimalist weather application coded in javascript.

The idea with this project was to display all of the pertinent information about the weather in as basic a way as possible.  The background is two seperate layers, one color that is decided by the temperature and a black and white gradient that changes with the time of day.

A working example can be found at www.jeffreylevifry.com/weather.
